## Motivation

I've been always thinking about launching my own website with my custom domain name (**satnaing.dev**) since my college student life. But that never happened until this project. I've done several projects and works about web application development but I didn't make an effort to do this.

So, "what about blog?" you may ask. Yeah, blog also has been in my  project list for some time. I always wanted to make a blog project using some of the latest technologies. However, I've been busy with my works and other projects so that blog project has never been started.

Then, one day, when I browse the internet and watching YouTube, one YouTuber (he is also a developer of course) suggested that devs should make a blog project in order to have their own platform to write down experiences and projects. After watching that clip, I decided to make a blog and my own portfolio as soon as possible. Plus, I have decent experiences and confidence to develop this project.

## Tech Stack

For the front-end, I wanted to use React. But React alone is not good enough for SEO; and I did have to consider many factors like routing etc. So, I chose NextJS as my main front-end stack. And of course TypeScript for type checking. (It's said that you'll love TypeScript when you're used to it ðŸ˜‰)

For styling, I use TailwindCSS. This is because I love developer experience that Tailwind gives and it has a lot of flexibilities compared to other component UI libraries like MUI or React Bootstrap.

All contents of this project reside within the GitHub repository. All my blog posts (including this one) are written in Markdown file format since I'm very used to with this. But to write Markdown along with its frontmatter effortlessly, I use Forestry headless CMS. It is a git-based CMS that can serve Markdown and other contents. Because of this, I can write my contents either using Markdown or wysiwyg editor. Besides, writing frontmatters with this is a breeze.

In conclusion, these are the tech stack I've used for this project.

* Front-end: NextJS (TypeScript)
* Styling: TailwindCSS
* CMS: Forestry Headless CMS
* Deployment: Vercel
